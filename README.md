# Pixiv Downloader written in Python

A little python script to download pixiv illustrations.

You probably have to provide a cookie if you want to download age restricted illustrations. (in the good old times the API didn't care, maybe it'll happen again...)

This is kind of a more advanced Hello World for me, so don't expect me to patch it if it ever breaks.

Dependencies:
- `requests`
